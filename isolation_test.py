"""
Ran 10 threads, each trying to create a review for the same booking and user at the same time.
After all threads finished, the  test checked how many reviews were created for that booking and user.
Result:
Number of reviews for booking 1 by user 1: 1
This means only one review was created, even under concurrent access.
This proves system/database correctly enforces isolation for this operation.
There are no anomalies (like duplicate reviews) even when many threads try to create a review at the same time.
Your business rule ("one review per user per booking") is safe from race conditions
